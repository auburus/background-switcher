# Background Switcher

Pet project to update my desktop background using the top post of
[r/earthporn](https://reddit.com/r/earthporn)

Note: I've got an XFCE desktop

## Usage

Run `make install` and it will install this script to run on *autostart*.

The [script](./background-switcher) is not very long, you can see easily
what it does.
